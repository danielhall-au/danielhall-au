## Hello thereðŸ‘‹, I'm Daniel. Senior full stack .Net Developer

Day-to-day you'll find me designing and delivering .Net solutions in Canberra, with a sprinkle of Azure on top. Off work you might find me fly fishing in the Snowy mountains by a stream or indulging in my passion for early vacuum tube mainframes.
